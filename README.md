# CS1302 Exam 01 Review v2020.sp #
### PLA(s): Xander Aviles and (Aiden) Geonhui Lee ##

**Review Session: 12:20 - 1:20 @ Boyd 208**

Intended to be used by CS1302 students at the University of Georgia, this review takes students through a comprehensive look of the material and concepts we have learned up to this point in the semester by combining the key concepts into one compact example. In this review, students will test their knowledge of unix commands, dependencies, interfaces, abstract classes, exceptions, javadocs, and nodes.

**This is not an official review written by the exam authors: Dr. Barnes and Dr. Cotterell. This review should not be used as the only resource you use to prepare for the exam.**

<!-- ## Navigating Unix ##

1. Change into cs1302-exam01Review (cd)

1. Look around the directory and get comfortable (ls)

1. Create the structures src/cs1302/practice and src/cs1302/interface in one command and without changing directories (mkdir and pipes)

1. Move the java files within the directory to src/cs1302/practice (mv)

1. Create cs1302.practice.Moveable, by copying the Animal.java (cp)

1. [bonus] Change into the src/cs1302/practice directory, how would you change back into cs1302-exam01Review in one command? (..)
